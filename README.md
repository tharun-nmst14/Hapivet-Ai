## ü©∫ Core Features

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Virtual Appointment / Consultation Platform
**üìò Idea:**  
A digital interface where pet owners can connect with veterinarians remotely.

**üß† Approach:**
- The website includes a ‚ÄúConsultation‚Äù section.  
- Two options appear:  
  - **Doctor Mode:** Mark availability and manage consultation slots.  
  - **Pet Owner Mode:** Book a consultation with an available doctor.  
- Once a request is sent and accepted, both parties can connect via **video call (concept using WebRTC/Jitsi)**.

**üõ†Ô∏è Tech (Concept):**
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- Backend: Flask / Node (for managing availability)  
- Video: WebRTC / Jitsi Meet API  

**‚ú® Expected Output:**  
Seamless virtual doctor-pet owner consultation experience.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Pet Health Rate Monitoring Device
**üìò Idea:**  
A wearable device continuously monitors a pet‚Äôs vital signs such as:
- Temperature  
- Heart rate  
- Activity level  

**üß† Approach:**
- The wearable device (conceptually) sends health data to the backend.  
- Data is analyzed using **rule-based or ML-based logic**.  
- If abnormal readings are detected, the system sends an **alert message** to the pet owner on the website dashboard.

**üí° Example Logic:**

```python
if temperature > 39 or heart_rate > 120:
    status = "Danger"
    send_alert_to_owner()
else:
    status = "Normal"

```
- Pet health data is collected.
- If a danger condition is detected ‚Üí alert is sent to the owner.
- Owner books a consultation.
- Doctor accepts ‚Üí connects for virtual call.
